# A Writers Mood

Hello FlameShadow!

Project Template:
* Navigation Drawer Activity

----- Added Files -----
* Java:
  * UI: newboard
    * NewBoardFragment
    * NewBoardViewModel
 
* XML:
  * layout:
    * fragment_newboard
    * ic_board_layout_one --> this is an include, I will add two more
  * values:
    * colors --> user theme color choices
    * strings --> many strings and many more to come

----- Updates & Notes -----
* Navigation Drawer:
  * Create New Board --> NewBoardFragment
    * The mood board example is an include, which I will make two more includes for the user to choose from and depending on what they choose
      the default include will either be replaced by another layout or the default will stay.
